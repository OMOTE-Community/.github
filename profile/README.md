## Under construction
This is the new place for the OMOTE universal remote project.
In future, there will be separate repos for
* hardware
* a C based software version
* a C++ software version (see comparison of firmwares below)
* MQTT keyboard
* in future maybe a web application for no code configuration of OMOTE
* in future maybe an OMOTE hub

Until everything has moved, please have a look at the old place of the repo (containing both hardware and software): https://github.com/CoretechR/OMOTE
